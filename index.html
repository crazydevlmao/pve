    const content = `I’ve lost faith in this market. It was built to fail. This is my final attempt to launch $PVE and save the trenches. For the last time, I will hold. For the last time, I will believe. For the last time, I will be the last man standing. One last dance. You chase narratives—PVE is the narrative. You chase legit devs—I’ve already proved myself. You chase runners—PVE is built to run. So tell me… what’s your excuse?

Attempt #6 to bring back the PVE meta. Enough pvp. Enough rotations. Enough. Believe in something. Believe in PVE. I will hold. I will be the last man standing on this coin.

Attempt #5 to launch $PVE. A coin built to spark a massive shift in traders’ mentality. I’m holding. I believe in $PVE. I believe in you. Let’s change the market. Let’s fight the PVP.
﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌

Other trench warriors joined my battle. I was sent 7% of the supply of a $PVE coin. I will hold. I will push. I will never sell. This is what I fight for. This is what I stand for. Bring back PVE.

Again, I was the last man standing. The last believer. I will keep trying. Every day. Until PVE become a thing. Rome was not built in a day. The PVE culture will take time. I will leaD the daNce. Will keep roundtripping. For the community. For the culture. Atempt #4 incoming. 
﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌
Third attempt. I will hold PVE. I believe in PVE. mPKuuopyzJfZiWZAcdj7xdHG6fuPBGzrSK74HNGpump

My second attempt to create a PVE runner and shift trenches mentality failed. I was the last man standing yet again. I sold after letting all holders exit. I will try again. I will never stop trying until trenches finally heal and learn that PVE > PVP. One day, PVE dev will be known as the savior of the trenches. The man who never stopped trying. The man who never stopped believing. The man. The. man. Until then, onto the third attempt to launch the PVE movement.

9/I burned 1% of the supply. Let this be a lesson: https://solscan.io/tx/2Zy1yKyZGqTyji7P86SYZXwTWgdCzGtMhMm8YHGxDKcZtGQApntZtCV1NmXJEAHHdUWdAm4Y8EujrpM9rS3AV8zn

8/I burned 1.2% of the supply. Let this be a lesson: https://solscan.io/tx/2NAzWi2a9Gh1Wc8yWwwrcje9gsG7xXVmGNDhoMLTng14khRknZ9bzYqvvYdgrumsnJCzcQj2crm2MT7SqA78RKFX

7/I’m not here for money. I’ve already roundtripped millions and I don’t care. The game needs to change and I’m here to do it. Memecoins need a future. PVP and destruction lead us nowhere. I’ll keep buying, burning, pushing and believing in $PVE until I’m the last one left standing. And when I fall, I’ll try again. And again. And again.

6/I burned 1.2% of the supply. Let this be a lesson: https://solscan.io/tx/5waVk7MzRy88vFu6QM96X8J4d68obpmQSAKa1BhbJ6W66BjrDpTK1ZQRa3k1xmfNCCtgik8xiHbLKTVoXN6Eb7p7

5/I burned 0.4% of the supply. Let this be a lesson: https://solscan.io/tx/5ZvxYiLDbMEyrMbwW5K8koPitUVguUD1SxiU9Mj1qJ9KmuRkPv1c9vMP5uyGbxN1Za8q2zysU3Ng18SyK2TyTiF9

4/DEX paid by myself. Will add a community link once a serious community is created. I will hold. Again. Roundtrip the whole bag if needed. And try again. PVE is a movement. Embrace PVE. Believe in PVE.

2/I tried. I failed. Two days ago, I launched $PVE with my last SOL. I held, I trusted, I believed. Watched over 10K vanish in front of me because I refused to give up on the community. I pushed with everything I had. The community pushed with everything they had. But nothing was enough. This space doesn’t want peace, it craves chaos. People chase PVP. People embrace destruction. I’ll launch $PVE again. And again. And again. Until this market remembers that belief and unity are stronger than self-destruction. Because one day, $PVE won’t just be a coin. It’ll be a movement. And I’ll be there, fighting for it. If this one fails, I will wait till I lose everything again. Sell at the bottom and try AGAIN. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.

1/I’ve been grinding Pumpfun for a year, and let me tell you — it was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me.

The market is down bad. Down in volume, down in vibes, down in numbers — even while Solana itself goes up. Why? The answer is simple: Player versus Player. For over 6 months, not a single true PVE coin. Not one coin that just keeps going up. Not one coin that makes people believe. Not one coin with more than four 15-minute green candles in a row. Not one coin that doesn't go down 50% in the first 5 minutes. Not one coin that makes sense. Not one coin unique. Nothing.

Back then, PVE was real. I turned $100 into $75,000 in a single day. Pure vibes. Pure belief. Pure community. Pure euphoria. Pure laughs. Pure innovation. Pure adrenaline. Pure brotherhood. Pure trust. Pure hope. You could change your LIFE overnight. Yes… your LIFE.

Today? It’s garbage. Bundled coins everywhere. Crybabies blaming losses on devs or KOLs. KOLs shilling their own bags, vamping coins from alt wallets and buying 15% of the supply at launch. Everyone just farming each other. PVP hell. Nightmare.

So this is my last message to the Trenches. WAKE UP! This is cancer. And if you don’t take care of it now, it will spread until nothing’s left. We will disappear as quickly as NFTs faded. We will be nothing more than the wreckage of a technology that had the power to change everything — but we were the ones who tore it apart. I’m launching one final PVE attempt. The last shot to prove a point. The last chance to show we’re not just rats fighting over scraps. The last attempt. One last dance. This could be the birth of a new meta… or the death of it all.

I won’t sell. I’ll ride every green candle with you. I’ll round-trip five, six, seven, eight, nine digits. I'll become a legend for holding that long. I'll become an example for future traders. I'll become a myth. I’ll back $PVE from the shadows. I’ll pay for DEX if a community is built for $PVE. I’ll buy boosts for $PVE. I'll pay promotion for $PVE. I'll shill $PVE to all my friends. All I want is to feel something again. To feel PVE. To feel traders happy for each other. To feel real energy. To feel aggressive pumps. To see OG wallets full-porting. To see lives changed. To see a coin posted all over CT. To feel like we finally created something together, instead of just stealing viral ideas from X or TikTok and tokenizing them. To feel like we’re united, even if just once more.

Incase this ever picks up, I will continuously update the website with links [Community, Buy Backs, Burns & more]
