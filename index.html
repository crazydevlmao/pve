I’ve been grinding Pumpfun for a year, and let me tell you — it was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me.

The market is down bad. Down in volume, down in vibes, down in numbers — even while Solana itself goes up. Why? The answer is simple: Player versus Player. For over 6 months, not a single true PVE coin. Not one coin that just keeps going up. Not one coin that makes people believe. Not one coin with more than four 15-minute green candles in a row. Not one coin that doesn't go down 50% in the first 5 minutes. Not one coin that makes sense. Not one coin unique. Nothing.

Back then, PVE was real. I turned $100 into $75,000 in a single day. Pure vibes. Pure belief. Pure community. Pure euphoria. Pure laughs. Pure innovation. Pure adrenaline. Pure brotherhood. Pure trust. Pure hope. You could change your LIFE overnight. Yes… your LIFE.

Today? It’s garbage. Bundled coins everywhere. Crybabies blaming losses on devs or KOLs. KOLs shilling their own bags, vamping coins from alt wallets and buying 15% of the supply at launch. Everyone just farming each other. PVP hell. Nightmare.

So this is my last message to the Trenches. WAKE UP! This is cancer. And if you don’t take care of it now, it will spread until nothing’s left. We will disappear as quickly as NFTs faded. We will be nothing more than the wreckage of a technology that had the power to change everything — but we were the ones who tore it apart. I’m launching one final PVE attempt. The last shot to prove a point. The last chance to show we’re not just rats fighting over scraps. The last attempt. One last dance. This could be the birth of a new meta… or the death of it all.

I won’t sell. I’ll ride every green candle with you. I’ll round-trip five, six, seven, eight, nine digits. I'll become a legend for holding that long. I'll become an example for future traders. I'll become a myth. I’ll back $PVE from the shadows. I’ll pay for DEX if a community is built for $PVE. I’ll buy boosts for $PVE. I'll pay promotion for $PVE. I'll shill $PVE to all my friends. All I want is to feel something again. To feel PVE. To feel traders happy for each other. To feel real energy. To feel aggressive pumps. To see OG wallets full-porting. To see lives changed. To see a coin posted all over CT. To feel like we finally created something together, instead of just stealing viral ideas from X or TikTok and tokenizing them. To feel like we’re united, even if just once more.

Incase this ever picks up, I will continuously update the website with links [Community, Buy Backs, Burns & more]
