    const content = `I’m done with memecoin trading. This is my last SOL.

I’ve been grinding Pumpfun for a year, and let me tell you — it was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me.

The market is down bad. Down in volume, down in vibes, down in numbers — even while Solana itself goes up. Why? The answer is simple: Player versus Player. For over 6 months, not a single true PVE coin. Not one coin that just keeps going up. Not one coin that makes people believe. Not one coin with more than four 15-minute green candles in a row. Not one coin that doesn't go down 50% in the first 5 minutes. Not one coin that makes sense. Not one coin unique. Nothing.

Back then, PVE was real. I turned $100 into $75,000 in a single day. Pure vibes. Pure belief. Pure community. Pure euphoria. Pure laughs. Pure innovation. Pure adrenaline. Pure brotherhood. Pure trust. Pure hope. You could change your LIFE overnight. Yes… your LIFE.

Today? It’s garbage. Bundled coins everywhere. Crybabies blaming losses on devs or KOLs. KOLs shilling their own bags, vamping coins from alt wallets and buying 15% of the supply at launch. Everyone just farming each other. PVP hell. Nightmare.

So this is my last message to the Trenches. WAKE UP! This is cancer. And if you don’t take care of it now, it will spread until nothing’s left. We will disappear as quickly as NFTs faded. We will be nothing more than the wreckage of a technology that had the power to change everything — but we were the ones who tore it apart. I’m launching one final PVE attempt. The last shot to prove a point. The last chance to show we’re not just rats fighting over scraps. The last attempt. One last dance. This could be the birth of a new meta… or the death of it all.

I won’t sell. I’ll ride every green candle with you. I’ll round-trip five, six, seven, eight, nine digits. I'll become a legend for holding that long. I'll become an example for future traders. I'll become a myth. I’ll back $PVE from the shadows. I’ll pay for DEX if a community is built for $PVE. I’ll buy boosts for $PVE. I'll pay promotion for $PVE. I'll shill $PVE to all my friends. All I want is to feel something again. To feel PVE. To feel traders happy for each other. To feel real energy. To feel aggressive pumps. To see OG wallets full-porting. To see lives changed. To see a coin posted all over CT. To feel like we finally created something together, instead of just stealing viral ideas from X or TikTok and tokenizing them. To feel like we’re united, even if just once more.

Incase this ever picks up, I will continuously update the website with links [Community, Buy Backs, Burns & more]

We are Solana. We are pumpfun. We are tomorrow. We are Trenchers.

4/A true PVE can only happen with a shift in mentality. It may take time, but it will happen. The secret is believing in something. If you expect me to sell, you’ll be disappointed.

5/Core community looking solid. KOLs fomo'ing hard yet selling too early because they are used to PVP. We will educate them. Key Opinion Leaders turned into Kinda Overrated Losers. Let the $PVE begin. 

6/The community isn’t just watching anymore — they’re stepping into the movement. In most PVPs, people sit on the sidelines. But here, they’re digging into their pockets, fueling the message, and rewriting what happens in the trenches. I’m proud of us. This is only the beginning. I want us to be beautifully delusional. I want us to believe that even 100M feels undervalued. I want us to shake the entire ecosystem to its core. This is $PVE.

7/Once holders stop rotating and feeding the PVP culture, something magical happens — they start believing. They stop burning brain cells trying to outclick the next guy and instead find joy in building connections, sharing laughs, and making money together. That’s what true PVE is all about. Not chaos, but unity. Not greed, but a movement. $PVE was born from that vision. Call me delusional if you want, but 200k isn’t even scratching the surface — it’s not even 1% of where we’re heading.

8/Traders must understand — a coin’s true potential isn’t chained to short-term price action. The biggest repricings often come late, when almost no one expects them. There is no perfect pattern between time and fair-value market cap. That’s why conviction matters. People need to hold for the core idea, not for the noise of market cap numbers. I believe this is worth 200M. I’ll wait for my target, no matter what the current chart says. Because this is what trading really means. The trenches have spent too long gambling, too long stuck in PVP. The Grand Rebirth was inevitable. And now, we will lead this new era.

9/Finally. A real community. Finally the energy feels alive. Finally the chart breathes health. Finally some common sense in this space. I don’t even care what the market cap says anymore — I closed the chart because the only thing worth watching is what’s happening here, inside this community. It’s beautiful. People are active, believing, dreaming, holding, and radiating positivity. No more PVP. No more gamble-trading. Just us and $PVE. I believe in Solana. I believe in this movement. Market cap is nothing but a snapshot of demand — numbers change, but conviction doesn’t. And if conviction stays, people follow. That’s the true power of belief. The future is bright. Our goal isn’t just $PVE — it’s reshaping the market itself. Becoming a META starter. An OG coin. The place where holders don’t just invest, they feel alive. Connected. United. This is what communities were always meant to be.`;
